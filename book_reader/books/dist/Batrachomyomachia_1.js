var TEXT ='<p class="chapter">PART 2</p><p class="text">The supreme leader\'s fame for nefarious machination, chicaneries and improbity was not enough to alter his subjects\' sense of chauvinism or to discourage them to enlist their sons into the military. Conscript Rudi and his colleague Shida remained faithful to their assigned mission. With a ration of tofu weighting 10 kg, they are expected to make an extensive reconnaissance of the enemy\'s camp within 2 days in the blizzardous environment of the Arctics. </p><p class="text">After reaching the apex of a cliff, they ensconced next to the entrance of a stratified ice cave to straighten their rakish polar bear skinned coat and hat. Rudi detached the hawser from his waist. When he saw that Shida was too busy searching for GPS signal, he assayed to remove the same rope from his friend\'s waist, but stopped in a qualm when he uncovered the silicone that was beginning to hang loll. A few minutes ago, Shida was attacked by a penguin and thought that caulking the laceration would protect if from the snow. Noticing his friend\'s concern, the taller man quickly tapped himself to resistute the caulk\'s position. Then he turned back to the gaze that hasn\'t ceased and averred jocularly, "I might have met my reaper today." But it was no time for levity. Rudi shook his head unsteadily while tears abruptly flooded out of his eye socket. He opened his mouth as to say something, but only a rueful lamenting sound ejected out. Aroused, Shida stuck his finger onto the other man\'s lips and calmy shushed, "These are all minutiae." Upon seeing the his comrade\'s simper, the shorter man hastened into a rampant lacrymosa instead. </p><p class="text">To think of Shida dying was like imagining his own posthumous life. Rudi cowered down. Soon he began to remember the days when they shared scanties during sleepover nights and the impromptu dance around the pyre. That performance was the result of a plethora of mosquito bites, mentally restated his alibi. Not for long, those reminiscences got disrupted by a warm nuzzling, which he received with a cringe. He immediately jerked away when he sensed his facial temperature rising. Nevertheless, the other man\'s head followed his movemnet, leaving him no alternatives to stay in such body configuration until his emotions were tempered - when he learned that the wound was nothing but a simple prank. </p><p class="text">"You thought I would leave you that easily?" Shida showed a pleasant, but ephemeral tittle as he was the inertial response. He pulled the caulk off of his coat, removed one of Rudi\'s gloves and brought the latter\'s hand near to the opening of the damaged polar bear skin. "Do you want to see it yourself?" he generously invited him in. </p><p class="text">At first Rudi did not object as if the sweeping movement of the coat\'s fur rekindled the growth of his eros onto a once more tangible ground. Though to resign to such feeling still sounded reprehensible. His gaze turned to the billowing flag on his colleague\'s bag and circumstantially fantasized for the bad ower an apposite wedding dress. That sense of ignominious instinct would blatantly decieve his ancestors and obliterate the somatic bound with the supreme figurehead that he erned from such much hardship. As lamentable as it is, he must continue to repudiate it, to abstain himself from it. But Shida\'s hedonistic and blithful personality may plausibly indulge his own failure. It may already had. It may indeed have completed the growth of his eros onto the absolute tangible ground. </p><p class="text">So he plugged his hands into the coat and searched for the pith. Sensing another cut in the inner cloth, his hand plummeted in fervently. When he reached the third layer, the still cold fingers of his make Shida shiver. But there were still more layers to unshroud, still more opportunities to warm up his hands. As he fell deeper and deeper into the layers, he finally perceived the essence of lascivious impulse that he had been carefully eschewing ever since they met. Now, there was no more control in his limb; the coat was itself sucking him in. While his heart beat and respiration rushed into a chaotic rhythm, each characterized by their own developing idiosyncrasy, he noticed by the similar thickness of their breath that his partner was experimenting the same sensations. Suddenly, the fur felt softer, the storm became warmer, the tofu in his bag, lighter, the hegemony, weakened, and the ahead glossy mustache, so alluring. Amazed by how taction could metamorphose the current mediocre setting into an euphoric paradise, Rudi continued in awe. It was better than mushrooms and cheese; it was better than fractals and programming. It could even be subject to its own form of liturgy with respect to an esoterica of his own. The man no longer fear of indulging, lifted his chin to mess his hair in the gentle breeze and to enjoy the chant of the enchanted crystalline brook. He imagined himself as a rainbow-scaled koi fish splashing in the stream, moving in and out of the water with elegance - moving in and out of the coat with liveliness. Irresistibly, he nodded his head to the same beat. </p><p class="text">"Rudi!"</p><p class="text">A seine hindered the koi fish and that dreamy world abraded away. "What is it?"</p><p class="text">"I think you made a hole to my underwear."</p><p class="text">Rudi slowly recuperated his hand. "Are you sure it wasn\'t already cut?"</p><p class="text">"Yes."</p><p class="text">"Oh..." He looked away. The storm for colder, the tofu, heavier, and programming seemed more appealing than anythin else in this world.</p><p class="text">But it wasn\'t over. Not yet. </p><p class="text">Shida took a plastic tube out from his pocket. "Do you want to caulk it?"</p>';
