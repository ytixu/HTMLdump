var TEXT ='<p class="chapter">PART 3</p><p class="text">"The statute says that you\'re old enough to fledge", her mother harangued in a manner that could make him fell picayune. Despite the inchoate agitation from the initially meaningless prattle, Shida still managed to divest the chicken from feather like the housewife pundit that she was told to be. She then scooped up the boiled eggs from from the stove with her bare hands and gouge out the yolk in a light-speed thumb movement. Though her cooking performance should be impressive in the eye of the common audience, its repetitiveness had already made Rudi lukewarm about it. The child instead stared rivetingly at his mother\'s morose feathery epaulets, that reminded him of Ryuk in Death Note. Motley suited her better, she has always though so; color mitigated her maniacal mogul look and leavened her inner affable, minion personality, as she knew before. </p><p class="text">Shida stuffed the yolk into the chicken\'s back orifice. Her husband is quite meticulous about the way to stuff it in; to sate his preference, the strength must match roughly the same strength she exerted to pull on her nuptial dress twenty-one years ago. Her size on the day of her matrimony was mainly defined by her pregnancy. As she recalled the moribund mongrel of one of the guests that made her trip and plummet into a premature delivery, she macerated the yolk with oil through massaging the marred chicken intensively, whose final appearance brought her thoughts onto her own maculated lower orifice before the statute agreed it to be maculated. </p><p class="text">She steeped the prunes and resumed her soliloquy, "Now don\'t you demur again. Leave this house next month and no need to care about me!" Rudi descried Shida\'s facial expression then turned back his stared at her ferrous fringe necklace. If he left, wouldn\'t that relieve her husband\'s hindrances in domestic abuse? Of course she noticed how her son watched her imbibing the man\'s flails with sullied shoe sole during childhood. Her lank limbs were no match to the sinewy inebriate sadist. Nobody outside of the house seemed to noticed his lechery in inducing pain as his face was imbued with a strong dye of fornication and miasmas of duplicities. There were nights when he would sneak out to forage women and came back late in the morning stippled with lips prints. Not that she cared about begin cheated, or the chastisement that he vouchsafed her daily. But her son? The orthodoxy may be that young adults leave their parents to seek for a life of their own, but the exigency to ensure ones mother\'s safety was stronger to compromise ones own future. "I don\'t want to stanch from protecting you," Rudi objected, "it\'s a quixotic wish." </p><p class="text">But is protection really Shida needed? That old man who blemished her body, forced her to grow talon nails (to please his own fetishism) had taken over more than simply her somatic self. After that got maculated, she could nonetheless have chosen to kill the fetus or to flee to a place where he could never find her. But the man daunted her to chose otherwise. When he made the decision of having her as wife, he had the juggernaut with him, and armed himself with flashing warning that he would ring the knell of anyone who would hamper him. He was a incendiary jingoist and everyone was afraid of getting incinerated by him. Not that he would kill Shida if she chose to kill herself. There was always a way to jeopardize her, like through Erica, her beautiful ex-fianc&eacute;e to whom she can forsake anything. That night when Shida was still brave to hide in Erica\'s bed, the man imperiously broke into her house with an leonine growl and tortured his impediment by placing kindled matches in her armpits until Shida agreed to never see her again. There here was no leeway for otherwise. </p><p class="text">She dump the chicken into the oven. Although her past is forced to abeyance in the post-marriage life, Shida couldn\'t forget the gall of her separation with Erica. To mentally limn juxtaposed luscious bodies of theirs was the only isthmus connecting them and keeping her in believing their inextinguishable flame of love. For the first two weeks, Shida\'s lackadaisical mood worsened her husband\'s temper. The story followed by an eddy of torment that encaged her for twenty-one years. As much as she wished to flap her wings again, the only consternation that kept her waiting was her son, who was still unaware of her adversity.</p>';
