$title$App Development Log

$shap$GRE Nexus

Day 1

Dear logger,

I found a very interesting idea for my first Windows Store App. It consists of graphing the GRE words according to the synonym relationship. It'll be a perfect tool to help me to prepare for my GRE test next Friday. I might need to rush a bit, but I have already gathered the data from another project that I worked during the beginning of this summer. I just need to watch a few tutorials and search a bit online, I'm sure I can create it in time. :)

Day 2

Dear logger, 

The summer research is obstructing my  plans, but I managed to finish a 30 minutes tutorials on YouTube. There's also a hands-on lab for Visual Studio beginners free to download online, but I think I'm better at exploring by myself than by reading instruction. Tomorrow I can start coding! 

Day 5

Dear logger, 

The first version is almost complete! I don't have time to create fancy animation for my graph, but it'll be fully functional once I finish debugging it. I would say, tomorrow I should be able to install it in my phone and then I'll have two days to enjoy my work on the bus!

Day 7

Dear logger, 

My app is officially in the store! You can go check it out at [insert link]. I only have a simple logo for now. But once I have time again, after the exam, I'll be able to amend it and also add animation to my graph. 

YAY! First app completed! \(ovo)/


REALITY

Day 15

Dear logger, 

I have finally made it run! I still don't know what exactly I did, but my XAML data file is ready and I can start to create the app now!

Day 21

Dear logger, 

After contemplating once more on my strategy, I finally decided to accept the hands-on lab, in hope that I can get an answer to where exactly app data is stored and how to load them. To my disappointment, the hands-on lab was designed with an older version of Visual Studio and so running it would require some maneuver. Just when I was about to suspend this project again, I discovered that I also have Blend for Visual Studio and from the online tutorial that I watched, it seems to match more my animation requirement. So I restarted this project, again, with Blend - and happily chose Javascript, CSS and HTML instead of C# and XAML. I thought this would avoid me the trouble to load data files. It did avoid me from that. It also prevented me to use their drawing tools. 

That's no big deal I thought; at worst, I'll have to draw nodes and edges with the classical Javascript function to manipulate canvas. But hell, that circle it made was sooooooo ugly. It was blurry like how Paint used to resize images without readjusting the resolution. This was really bad, because of course visual is the essence to catch the eyes of the users. I can forsake some fancy animation, but my circles must be attractive! This is worse than not being able to figure out how add data file, this worse than dropping my phone into a commode (which unfortunately happened just a few days ago). What is more discouraging is that I couldn't find any solution online to deal with this resolution problem as if I was the first unlucky (or lucky) one who encounter a such aberrant behavior. Mad, exhausted, I went back to Visual Studio and resume to solve the problem with data file loading, until my laptop finally complained about low battery. 

Today's work was wasted.

With that thought, I ran downstairs to hit on some spiders. Sure, maybe my app is still not in store, but through my experience with Visual Studio, I learnt that it gives me the power to do things that I would otherwise never have the power to do: killing cellar spiders.
