var TEXT ='<p class="chapter">PART 4</p><p class="text">The chicken got too burned to be salubrious. Rudi lifted Shida\'s tushed onto the counter, ousting the cherries and raspberries. Shida bawled in surprise. He demanded to be replaced down, but that only put him in a more ludicrous predicament. </p><p class="text">Rudi approaches his roommate\'s eyes, "I\'m not your son." His voice was low and creamy that melt to the ears. The capacious counter was enough to support both of them, but he kept his feet on the ground and only stretched out his arms on both side to prelude his target from escaping. </p><p class="text">Everything was a delusion caused by caulk poisoning. Rudi was not Shida\'s son. Shida was not married to a cantankerous macho and was not a transgender. They are not soldiers nor computer science magnates. They are kids, brought together by academical interests under the same roof, where Rudi inadvertently spilled a tube of caulk into the the other\'s kid\'s lunch - just after their amity upgraded to a caustic love. </p><p class="text">Although Shida\'s undermined memory may be a dike to their stream of romance, it was no scuttle of Rudi\'s hope to recover him. A soon as Rudi lied Shida down on the table, which immediately desisted the latter from struggling, he began to place berries onto the other kid\'s chest. It was a palliative to his roommate\'s condition. When the lying body was completely turned into an ornate fruit cake, he unshroud the drenched apron to let the skin absorb the remedy in the berries. To say that Shida was only wearing an apron in not the exact situation. He was only wearing a serrated edged stomacher. Shida made a inconspicuous noise while a cavalcade of berries rolled over his pallid abdomen onto the ceramic. But there was still a profuse remain. Rudi scrutinized the number and decided that it was enough. He then slowly reached a bottle of maple syrup in the nigh drawers and then unfettered it after spouting onto the same chest prodigally. When it touched the skin, the chilliness made Shida ejecting an overt squeak. With celerity, the liquid spread all over the luscious body. A few drops fell onto Rudi\'s right leg due to his maladroitness.</p><p class="text">At this point, the remedy had worked its way to the striatum. Rudi was surprised of his patient\'s precocious improvement. In the usual routine, he needed to decorate, unshroud and pour at last three times for Shida to enter a trance of acting lewd. Shida whisked the berries one by one into his orifice. When none was left, Rudi got even more surprised that Shida was still ambulatory to climb down the counter by himself to get the fruits on the ground. After these were devoured, Shida precipitously moved on to the syrup on Rudi\'s leg. As we know that the latter sleeps nudely (and he just woke up a few minutes earlier to find that his roommate was maculating a chicken while having hallucinations) the syrup was adhered to his bare leg. Shida ran the piece of musclefrom his orifice up Rudi\'s right leg, savoring every single stand of fur. He finished his meal with a sanguinary smile - and all the GRE words seemed to be engulfed into a tumult. </p>';
