Researcher Rudi and developer Shida were running around a pyre after having successfully undercut their competitors. "Wahoo!" Shida took out his camera and captured himself while posing pretentiously with the company's sale record on his phone. Only after looking at the snapshot did he realize that Rudi's ample movements were blurring the background. Indeed, the shorter boy was tracing fervently the steps of the type of dances that were typically categorized as syncopations. As Shida followed his partner's movement, the doting emotion grew in him again. Soon his initial innocent, agog stare turned into an ogle. When Rudi finished his twirls and threw himself lewdly onto the ground, eyes filled with the reflections of the fire sparks, Shida finally made an ironclad decision that shall conclude the struggles he went through every night. The taller boy dropped his camera on a rock and walked dallyingly towards the body still rolling on the ground. The higher resolution of the lint becomes suddenly irresistible. He gently put his hand onto his partner's lower abdomen and realized that he was touching fur instead. It was moving too fast, he thought; and Rudi was still wiggling to the soundless music. But after witnessing such magnificence, there was no holding back anymore. Stripping down all dissemblance, he approached the lying body ever closer for the first time.

The supreme leader's fame for nefarious machination, chicaneries and improbity was not enough to alter his subjects' sense of chauvinism or to discourage them to enlist their sons into the military. Conscript Rudi and his colleague Shida remained faithful to their assigned mission. With a ration of tofu weighting 10 kg, they are expected to make an extensive reconnaissance of the enemy's camp within 2 days in the blizzardous environment of the Arctics. 

After reaching the apex of a cliff, they ensconced next to the entrance of a stratified ice cave to straighten their rakish polar bear skinned coat and hat. Rudi detached the hawser from his waist. When he saw that Shida was too busy searching for GPS signal, he assayed to remove the same rope from his friend's waist, but stopped in a qualm when he uncovered the silicone that was beginning to hang loll. A few minutes ago, Shida was attacked by a penguin and thought that caulking the laceration would protect if from the snow. Noticing his friend's concern, the taller man quickly tapped himself to resistute the caulk's position. Then he turned back to the gaze that hasn't ceased and averred jocularly, “I might have met my reaper today.” But it was no time for levity. Rudi shook his head unsteadily while tears abruptly flooded out of his eye socket. He opened his mouth as to say something, but only a rueful lamenting sound ejected out. Aroused, Shida stuck his finger onto the other man's lips and calmy shushed, “These are all minutiae.” Upon seeing the his comrade's simper, the shorter man hastened into a rampant lacrymosa instead. 

To think of Shida dying was like imagining his own posthumous life. Rudi cowered down. Soon he began to remember the days when they shared scanties during sleepover nights and the impromptu dance around the pyre. That performance was the result of a plethora of mosquito bites, mentally restated his alibi. Not for long, those reminiscences got disrupted by a warm nuzzling, which he received with a cringe. He immediately jerked away when he sensed his facial temperature rising. Nevertheless, the other man's head followed his movemnet, leaving him no alternatives to stay in such body configuration until his emotions were tempered – when he learned that the wound was nothing but a simple prank. 

“You thought I would leave you that easily?” Shida showed a pleasant, but ephemeral tittle as he was the inertial response. He pulled the caulk off of his coat, removed one of Rudi's gloves and brought the latter's hand near to the opening of the damaged polar bear skin. “Do you want to see it yourself?” he generously invited him in. 

At first Rudi did not object as if the sweeping movement of the coat's fur rekindled the growth of his eros onto a once more tangible ground. Though to resign to such feeling still sounded reprehensible. His gaze turned to the billowing flag on his colleague's bag and circumstantially fantasized for the bad ower an apposite wedding dress. That sense of ignominious instinct would blatantly decieve his ancestors and obliterate the somatic bound with the supreme figurehead that he erned from such much hardship. As lamentable as it is, he must continue to repudiate it, to abstain himself from it. But Shida's hedonistic and blithful personality may plausibly indulge his own failure. It may already had. It may indeed have completed the growth of his eros onto the absolute tangible ground. 

So he plugged his hands into the coat and searched for the pith. Sensing another cut in the inner cloth, his hand plummeted in fervently. When he reached the third layer, the still cold fingers of his make Shida shiver. But there were still more layers to unshroud, still more opportunities to warm up his hands. As he fell deeper and deeper into the layers, he finally perceived the essence of lascivious impulse that he had been carefully eschewing ever since they met. Now, there was no more control in his limb; the coat was itself sucking him in. While his heart beat and respiration rushed into a chaotic rhythm, each characterized by their own developing idiosyncrasy, he noticed by the similar thickness of their breath that his partner was experimenting the same sensations. Suddenly, the fur felt softer, the storm became warmer, the tofu in his bag, lighter, the hegemony, weakened, and the ahead glossy mustache, so alluring. Amazed by how taction could metamorphose the current mediocre setting into an euphoric paradise, Rudi continued in awe. It was better than mushrooms and cheese; it was better than fractals and programming. It could even be subject to its own form of liturgy with respect to an esoterica of his own. The man no longer fear of indulging, lifted his chin to mess his hair in the gentle breeze and to enjoy the chant of the enchanted crystalline brook. He imagined himself as a rainbow-scaled koi fish splashing in the stream, moving in and out of the water with elegance – moving in and out of the coat with liveliness. Irresistibly, he nodded his head to the same beat. 

“Rudi!”

A seine hindered the koi fish and that dreamy world abraded away. “What is it?”

“I think you made a hole to my underwear.”

Rudi slowly recuperated his hand. “Are you sure it wasn't already cut?”

“Yes.”

“Oh...” He looked away. The storm for colder, the tofu, heavier, and programming seemed more appealing than anythin else in this world.

But it wasn't over. Not yet. 

Shida took a plastic tube out from his pocket. “Do you want to caulk it?”

"The statute says that you're old enough to fledge", her mother harangued in a manner that could make him fell picayune. Despite the inchoate agitation from the initially meaningless prattle, Shida still managed to divest the chicken from feather like the housewife pundit that she was told to be. She then scooped up the boiled eggs from from the stove with her bare hands and gouge out the yolk in a light-speed thumb movement. Though her cooking performance should be impressive in the eye of the common audience, its repetitiveness had already made Rudi lukewarm about it. The child instead stared rivetingly at his mother's morose feathery epaulets, that reminded him of Ryuk in Death Note. Motley suited her better, she has always though so; color mitigated her maniacal mogul look and leavened her inner affable, minion personality, as she knew before. 

Shida stuffed the yolk into the chicken's back orifice. Her husband is quite meticulous about the way to stuff it in; to sate his preference, the strength must match roughly the same strength she exerted to pull on her nuptial dress twenty-one years ago. Her size on the day of her matrimony was mainly defined by her pregnancy. As she recalled the moribund mongrel of one of the guests that made her trip and plummet into a premature delivery, she macerated the yolk with oil through massaging the marred chicken intensively, whose final appearance brought her thoughts onto her own maculated lower orifice before the statute agreed it to be maculated. 

She steeped the prunes and resumed her soliloquy, “Now don't you demur again. Leave this house next month and no need to care about me!” Rudi descried Shida's facial expression then turned back his stared at her ferrous fringe necklace. If he left, wouldn't that relieve her husband's hindrances in domestic abuse? Of course she noticed how her son watched her imbibing the man's flails with sullied shoe sole during childhood. Her lank limbs were no match to the sinewy inebriate sadist. Nobody outside of the house seemed to noticed his lechery in inducing pain as his face was imbued with a strong dye of fornication and miasmas of duplicities. There were nights when he would sneak out to forage women and came back late in the morning stippled with lips prints. Not that she cared about begin cheated, or the chastisement that he vouchsafed her daily. But her son? The orthodoxy may be that young adults leave their parents to seek for a life of their own, but the exigency to ensure ones mother's safety was stronger to compromise ones own future. “I don't want to stanch from protecting you,” Rudi objected, “it's a quixotic wish.” 

But is protection really Shida needed? That old man who blemished her body, forced her to grow talon nails (to please his own fetishism) had taken over more than simply her somatic self. After that got maculated, she could nonetheless have chosen to kill the fetus or to flee to a place where he could never find her. But the man daunted her to chose otherwise. When he made the decision of having her as wife, he had the juggernaut with him, and armed himself with flashing warning that he would ring the knell of anyone who would hamper him. He was a incendiary jingoist and everyone was afraid of getting incinerated by him. Not that he would kill Shida if she chose to kill herself. There was always a way to jeopardize her, like through Erica, her beautiful ex-fiancée to whom she can forsake anything. That night when Shida was still brave to hide in Erica's bed, the man imperiously broke into her house with an leonine growl and tortured his impediment by placing kindled matches in her armpits until Shida agreed to never see her again. There here was no leeway for otherwise. 

She dump the chicken into the oven. Although her past is forced to abeyance in the post-marriage life, Shida couldn't forget the gall of her separation with Erica. To mentally limn juxtaposed luscious bodies of theirs was the only isthmus connecting them and keeping her in believing their inextinguishable flame of love. For the first two weeks, Shida's lackadaisical mood worsened her husband's temper. The story followed by an eddy of torment that encaged her for twenty-one years. As much as she wished to flap her wings again, the only consternation that kept her waiting was her son, who was still unaware of her adversity.

The chicken got too burned to be salubrious. Rudi lifted Shida's tushed onto the counter, ousting the cherries and raspberries. Shida bawled in surprise. He demanded to be replaced down, but that only put him in a more ludicrous predicament. 

Rudi approaches his roommate's eyes, “I'm not your son.” His voice was low and creamy that melt to the ears. The capacious counter was enough to support both of them, but he kept his feet on the ground and only stretched out his arms on both side to prelude his target from escaping. 

Everything was a delusion caused by caulk poisoning. Rudi was not Shida's son. Shida was not married to a cantankerous macho and was not a transgender. They are not soldiers nor computer science magnates. They are kids, brought together by academical interests under the same roof, where Rudi inadvertently spilled a tube of caulk into the the other's kid's lunch – just after their amity upgraded to 
a caustic love. 

Although Shida's undermined memory may be a dike to their stream of romance, it was no scuttle of Rudi's hope to recover him. A soon as Rudi lied Shida down on the table, which immediately desisted the latter from struggling, he began to place berries onto the other kid's chest. It was a palliative to his roommate's condition. When the lying body was completely turned into an ornate fruit cake, he unshroud the drenched apron to let the skin absorb the remedy in the berries. To say that Shida was only wearing an apron in not the exact situation. He was only wearing a serrated edged stomacher. Shida made a inconspicuous noise while a cavalcade of berries rolled over his pallid abdomen onto the ceramic. But there was still a profuse remain. Rudi scrutinized the number and decided that it was enough. He then slowly reached a bottle of maple syrup in the nigh drawers and then unfettered it after spouting onto the same chest prodigally. When it touched the skin, the chilliness made Shida ejecting an overt squeak. With celerity, the liquid spread all over the luscious body. A few drops fell onto Rudi's right leg due to his maladroitness.

At this point, the remedy had worked its way to the striatum. Rudi was surprised of his patient's precocious improvement. In the usual routine, he needed to decorate, unshroud and pour at last three times for Shida to enter a trance of acting lewd. Shida whisked the berries one by one into his orifice. When none was left, Rudi got even more surprised that Shida was still ambulatory to climb down the counter by himself to get the fruits on the ground. After these were devoured, Shida precipitously moved on to the syrup on Rudi's leg. As we know that the latter sleeps nudely (and he just woke up a few minutes earlier to find that his roommate was maculating a chicken while having hallucinations) the syrup was adhered to his bare leg. Shida ran the piece of musclefrom his orifice up Rudi's right leg, savoring every single stand of fur. He finished his meal with a sanguinary smile - and all the GRE words seemed to be engulfed into a tumult.
