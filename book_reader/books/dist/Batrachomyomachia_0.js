"Wahoo!" Shida took out his camera and captured himself while posing pretentiously with the company\'s sale record on his phone. Only after looking at the snapshot did he realize that Rudi\'s ample movements were blurring the background. Indeed, the shorter boy was tracing fervently the steps of the type of dances that were typically categorized as syncopations.

The taller boy dropped his camera on a rock and walked dallyingly towards the body still rolling on the ground. The higher resolution of the lint becomes suddenly irresistible. He gently put his hand onto his partner\'s lower abdomen and realized that he was touching fur instead. It was moving too fast, he thought; and Rudi was still wiggling to the soundless music. But after witnessing such magnificence, there was no holding back anymore. Stripping down all dissemblance, he approached the lying body ever closer for the first time.</p>';
