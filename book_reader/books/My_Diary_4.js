So let\'s get started. Let\'s talk about my real diary.</p><p class="text">June 16, 2014</p><p class="text">I was born and the feel of my mother\'s blood covering my cheeks and stuck in my nail was exceptionally memorable - the only time ever when such intimate body with body mixture can ever happen. It\'s indeed a sacred moment for both of us, despite how she abhors the pain when I push her inside with my feet. </p><p class="text">June 17, 2013</p><p class="text">I learned how to play a flute and how to dance on water. Notice that I couldn\'t have learned them without travelling back in time. I can see my mother\'s big belly. She had me since a few years ago. That parasitism was longer than what you think.</p><p class="text">September 14, 1992</p><p class="text">I don\'t know what to write anymore, because I need a big text, but it\'s hard to talk about a melon parasite inside of a frog if you haven\'t seen one before. And believe me; I have never seen a parasitic melon inside a frog - either! Today is weird. </p><p class="text">Ganuary 11, 1111</p><p class="text">I misspelled the date. Let me redo it.</p>';
