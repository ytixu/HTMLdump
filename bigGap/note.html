	<li><a name="one"></a>From <i>National Vital Statistic Report</i>, life expectancy is 78.7 years in 2010. From the study <i>Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise</i>, the average steps that Americans take is 5,117 in same year. Supposing that human start walking at the age of one and that one step is 0.75 meters, the approximate walking distance in a lifetime is about 110,000 km.

	<li><a name="two"></a>A quote from Galileo, Il Saggiatore [The Assayer], 1623. (<a target="biblio" href="biblio.html#hirshfeld">Hirshfeld, 2004</a>)
	</li>
	<li><a name="three"></a>Although Aristarchus is not the first discoverer of the heliocentric system, the Copernican system developed in the mid-sixteenth century may have been influenced by his hypothesis. Despite the closeness of his model to the one believed nowadays, most ancient Greek successors in astronomy are tempted to be geocentrists due to the Aristotle's influence. (<a target="biblio" href="biblio.html#africa">Africa, 1961</a>)
	</li>
	<li><a name="four"></a>Based on the hypothesis that the lunar orbit is a perfect circle, that a lunar cycle is 29 Earth days, and that the Moon's speed is always constant, the time from the third quarter Moon to the new Moon and from the latter to the first quarter is 7 days, i.e.: the angular distance is 360&deg; &times; 729 &asymp; 87&deg;. The validity of this derivation can be proven false by Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which is nonetheless only discovered 1800 years after Aristarchus deceases.
	</li>
	<li><a name="five"></a>Based on similar triangles, if the apparent lunar size is &alpha; when passing the perigee (distance = 363,104 km), then the apparent lunar size &beta; at the apogee (distance = 405,696 km) is (405,696 / 363,104) &alpha; = 1.11730 &alpha;, i.e.: 10 % bigger.
	</li>
	<li><a name="six"></a>Some other sources suggest that several measurements have been made beyond the Alexandria-Syene experiment and the number 252,000 stadia is chosen instead perhaps to satisfy the desire of having easily divisible numbers, i.e.: if 252,000 stadia is a full circle, then 700 stadia is one degree, while with 250,000 stadia, a degree would be 694 4/9 (<a target="biblio" href="biblio.html#martin">Martin, 1839</a>).
	</li>
	<li><a name="seven"></a>The exact length of a stadium is not standardized in ancient Greeks. The accurate conversion is thus left for assumptions. The generally accepted conversion of Eratosthenes' result based on the Egyptian’s unit of measurement, schoenus. Derived from the results in pyramid measurements, the conversion gives 39,690 km for Earth circumference with 0.8 % difference with the mean radius known today. This value of the stadium however would be uncommon and thus unlikely. A second hypothesis refers to the Heronian tables which results 37,497 km with 5.5 % different more than the previous one despite that the value of this stadium is more plausible (Diller, 1949). Yet, the first conjecture will be applied to the calculations that follow in this paper.
	</li>
	<li><a name="eight"></a>According to Aristarchus' 7:1 ratio, Saturn's mean radius = 58,232 km &gt; 7 &times; 6,316 km = 44,212 km &gt; 25,362 km = Uranus' mean radius. As a side note, if the Sun's actual size is likewise in a parallel universe (where perhaps fusion starts at a higher density or a lower mass), then it would be inaccurate to call it "super-dwarf star" since the astronomical scale is based to the size of the most accessible relevant object and thus the HR diagram, if it existed, would be graphed differently.
	</li>
	<li><a name="nine"></a>It takes 1.3 light seconds to cover a distance of 384,400 km. Thus, according to Aristarchus' 19:1 ratio, it takes (189,480 / 384,400) &times; 1.3 &times; 19 = 12.2 light seconds to go to the Sun. The actual number is 8 light minutes. 
	</li>
	<li><a name="ten"></a>The actual ratio is 23,480.
	</li>
	<li><a name="eleven"></a>Consider the validity of the result if taking tidal force into account. It has been detected by NASA from the Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) mission that the Moon is retreating from Earth at a rate of 3.8 cm per year (<a target="biblio" href="biblio.html#dickey">Dickey, 1994</a>). Suppose that this rate has stayed constant for more than two millenaries, then the mean distance of the Moon during Hipparchus times around 0.1 km less than today, which is a negligible amount and should not cause the lunar distance to have one Earth radius less than today.
	</li>
	<li><a name="twelve"></a>Some who refused to believe that Ptolemy and Eratosthenes would contradict each other adopted the assumption that Ptolemy's stadium about a third larger than Eratosthenes' (<a target="biblio" href="biblio.html#diller">Diller, 1949</a>).
	</li>
	<li><a name="thirdteen"></a>Although, Hipparchus uses an Earth circumference of a few less than 277,000 stadia (<a target="biblio" href="biblio.html#martin">Martin Leake, 1839</a>), which causes him to have a percent difference of about 6 %, the ratio of Earth’s diameter and lunar distance, independent of the numerical values, is still accurate to more than 98 %. 
	</li>
	<li><a name="fourteen"></a>The actual ratio is around 2.64. Using similar triangles, given that RM/2 = 6,371 km, the ratio of Earth's shadow's length minus lunar distance and Earth's shadow's length is (108(2 &times; 6,371) - 384,000) / (108(2 &times; 6,371)) = 0.72 (recall that D<sub>M</sub> = 384,400 km). Then given that R<sub>M</sub>/2 = 1,737 km the R<sub>E</sub>'/R<sub>M</sub> ratio is (0.72 &times; 6,371) / 1,737 = 2.64.
	</li>
	<li><a name="fifteen"></a>If current values are used (R<sub>E</sub>'/R<sub>M</sub> = 2.64), the distance is slightly less than 60 Earth radii. The error is due to the fact that the actual mean D<sub>M</sub>/R<sub>M</sub> ratio is 384,400 / (2 &times; 1737.5) = 110.62.
