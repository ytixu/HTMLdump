### Secrets
* Refresh the page to see new colors.
* Click on the Javascript code, click again and you'll see that the initial comment may have changed.
* If you click on the Javscript code enough times, a surpise message will replace the comment. 
* If you continue to click on the Javscript code, there will be another surpise message. 
* The third time a new surpise message appears, you'd have already clicked 100 times. 
* If you are interested in my project, you can help me test if the last surprise message works. You simply need to click 1000 times. :)
