				<h3>Creating G&Phi;LDEN HackNights</h3>
				<h5>Towards hosting a "fictional" hackathon and designing a webpage.</h5>
			</div>
			<div id="postContent">
			<p>Presenting to you <a href="../../hacknights/index.html">G&Phi;LDEN HackNights</a>. This hackathon happens every night of every day, in every corner of the globe. Everyone can attend and every idea is accepted (at the creator's own risk). </p>
			<h4>Creation of G&Phi;LDEN HackNights</h4>
			<p>Learning Node.js was my initial goal for creating this website. I was determined to know how to keep a database, make logins and understand why "Node.js is the only real Dev language". After watching a short tutorial, I followed the steps to download node and express, and started using jade. It was a lot simpler than I thought. Just type the command to build the project with express, install it, and run it with nodemon. Simple. But that feeling of AWYEAAAA-finally-gonna-unlock-skills-for-backend did not last very long as I learned that GitHub doesn't host dynamic web page. After spending hours trying to figure out how to us OpenShift, generating SSH key, I decided to fall back to ground zero. </p>
			<p>After using Jade, going back to HTML made me feel a bit retarded. But as this is life, (and I have a huge stack of school work waiting for me to pop), I shall stick with static web page for now.</p>

			<h4>No database? Use an API!</h4>
			<p>There are a number of APIs that I used for this web page. 
			<ul><li>To get the time remaining before the start and end of a hacknight (sunset and sunrise time), I used OpenStreetMap API to get geographical coordinate of an input location, and Sunset and sunrise times API to get the sunset and sunrise time for that location.</li>
			<li>To obtain background image that changes everyday, I used Bing's image of the day.</li>
			<li>To register participants, I created a Google Form.</li>
			<li>Then I was curious to know what interesting APIs were out there and found ItsThisForThat that generates random "startup" ideas.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h4>Challenges</h4>
			<p>The most challenging part of this project, is to figure out how to make the CSS work for all browsers. It's very nice that Chrome has all those little things to adds sparks to your website. But as soon as you open on Firefox, or worse on IE, the magic of CSS dies. That clipping mask with the title text for example doesn't work on both Firefox and IE. After I wrote the fallbacks, I was happy to see that every thing works as expected on all three browsers, except on the IE that I have on my phone. In the end, I solved that problem by installing Chrome on my phone - and wait for Spartan to come out.</p>
			<p>Ah~ can't wait to test on Safari and Opera...</p>
